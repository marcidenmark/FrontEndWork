MAP
(map) is a built in helper
(map) is a property of an array
array.map returns a function
array.map returns a a new array

and on that function you can pass an object (true?)

//EXAMPLE
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array.map(function(number) {return number * 2});
//gives [2, 4, 6]
Every JS funtion is  a function object

// below, multiple properties off of the props object
