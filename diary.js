// most helpful thing I learned today...

Septermber 20:
React + Javascript Huge thing understood today:
In CONST COMPONENTS you write props.blabla
In a CLASS BASED COMPONENT you write this.props.blabla

September 21:
.map is a property of an array.
and
array.map returns a function. (true?)
and on that function you can pass an object (true?)
//EXAMPLE
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array.map(function(number) {return number * 2});
//gives [2, 4, 6]
Every JS funtion is  a function object
